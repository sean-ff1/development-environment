Maerchyng says, "Andolor has many more mysteries for you to uncover. Visit
 Kimr at his Farm to uncover a new goal, or try boarding the train in Lands
 of Legend. There is also a goal in the Art of Melody for you to discover.
 When you reach level 15, visit the Call of Heroes and listen to Mystlin. I
 wish you good fortune in your travels JeromeTheShy."
